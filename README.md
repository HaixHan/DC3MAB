# DC3MAB
It's about DC^3MAB algorithm. The original paper is "Dynamic clustering based contextual combinatorial multi-armed bandit for online recommendation"
Here, we just provide the processed dataset of IJCAI-15, which selects 1,000 test users. You can dircetly run "run_code.ipynb" to see the result. "DCMAB.py" is the core code.
